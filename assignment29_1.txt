4. Associated Data Files
You should form a table on a worksheet titled "class list" that includes the names and test scores of your students. You have 7 students in your class, their names are: Allen, Borlin, Catlin, Dorsey, Eugene, Finneran, and Greco. Their scores on the first 3 tests are as follows:

		Test 1		Test 2		Test 3
Allen 		Test 89 	Test 78 	Test 89 
Borlin 		Test 67 	Test 56 	Test 66 
Catlin 		Test 78 	Test 76 	Test 76 
Dorsey 		Test 56 	Test 34 	Test 45 
Eugene 		Test 26 	Test 100 	Test 99 
Finerran 	Test 99 	Test 98 	Test 97 
Greco 		Test 78 	Test 87 	Test 88 


5. Problem Statement
• Using an Excel function, show each student's average in an additional column labeled "Average"


• Using an Excel function, show each student's rounded average in an additional column labeled "Rounded Average"


• If a student's rounded average is above "95", he/she has received "honors" in the class. In an additional column titled "Honors", insert a function that will return the word "Yes" if they have received honors, otherwise would return the word "No"


• If a student's rounded average is 90 or greater, they receive an "A". Between 80 and 90 is a "B", between 70 and 80 is a "C", between 60 and 70 is a "D", and lower than 60 is an "F". Somewhere on your sheet, enter this information in cells. Create an additional column titled "Grade" and insert a nested IF function that returns the appropriate grade for each student. Use an absolute cell references in your nested IF function to indicate cut-off points between grades. Hint: You will need to place the "cut-off grade" values in cells somewhere on your worksheet.
